# IDL Spring 2022 Project - Probabilistic Forecasting of stock prices with Deep AR.

## Get started
1. Modify Parent Folder path in src/constants.py to current directory.

## Scripts for data preparation
1. [company_data.py](https://github.com/priyank96/idl-spring-22-project-deepar/blob/main/src/data/company_data.py) - To process data and generate windowed time series. 
2. [company_random_groups.py](https://github.com/priyank96/idl-spring-22-project-deepar/blob/main/src/data/company_random_groups.py) - To process data and generate windowed time series for grouped vector inputs.

Note: The appropriate data generation scripts are generated by the appropriate notebooks
